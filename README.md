                    Custom housing for smart home utility tool. <br>
                        Or in laymans terms, I took the audio output of Amazon's Alexa and funneled it through a Arduino to convert the audio into DC motor movements. <br>
                        Fun and hilarious hardware hack inspired by an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Animate-a-Billy-Bass-Mouth-With-Any-Audio-Source/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">instructable's guide</a>.</br>
                        The orignial guide only included lip movements and I customized it to add in head and tail movements of the Billy Bass Fish.<br>
